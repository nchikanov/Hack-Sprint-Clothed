# My Closet
As a part of UCLA ACM's Hack Sprint 2017, I created my first iOS application using XCode's iOS development tool. 

# Overview
MyCloset is a wardrobe suggestion engine based on clothing you already own. Designed for those who need some extra reminders of what clothing combinations match the current weather or color scheme that they want for the day. Can help get those people out the door quicker in the morning while still looking great!

# Technicalities
Two-screen multi-view iOS App. 
The load screen allows the user to choose from multiple Weather and Color Scheme options. Then, it brings them to the clothing selector, which displays clothing based on the conditions specified on the load screen. Users can click each area of the wardrobe (shirt, pants, hat, shoes) to randomly select another clothing item within that area, or they can click the button at the bottom of the screen to randomize the entire outfit. 

# Potential 
1. Users can take pictures of their clothes and upload the articles directly into the app with tags (i.e. Sunny, Neutral) 
2. Save outfits that you like
3. Sync with Weather app to make selections more accurate 
4. Add layers to clothing (i.e. Long sleeved shirt, Jacket, Scarf for cold days instead of just Jacket)
